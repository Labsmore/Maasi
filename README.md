**HardwareX Paper**: In review

  

## The tl;dr

  

Here we present Maasi, an affordable Spin Coater that is easy to build and has all functional key features to be used in a wide range of applications up to 8000 RPM. Our design has a price of approximately 85 â‚¬ and an assembly time of 2 hours. One of the design principles that guided the design was to use only 3D printed parts and affordable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. In order to keep a low part count we use an electronic speed controller (ESC) with telemetry, this eliminates the need for a rotor sensor.

## What is included?

* Computer Aided Design (CAD) files of the complete assembly.

* 3D printable .3MF files.

* Nextion Editor project for the Graphical user interface (GUI).

* Arduino firmware to coordinate the process.

* Bill of materials for sourcing and purchasing materials.

* Detailed assembly instructions of hardware components.

  

## Getting Started

### 3D printing components and purchasing hardware

The 3D printed components can be fabricated on any desktop fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer. They were designed using [Autodesk Fusion 360](http://autodesk.com/fusion360), a proprietary CAD software that offers free academic licenses.
